# Band Basic

This is the repo for Band Basic, a project I was working on and was featured in my YouTube series [Shopify Theme Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0IuScpWvJY&list=PLUG6vnlr4I_TGLeVtSergbkSUNfJ54w9J) as well as my first 10 [Shopify Dev Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTQJG9b3K6U&list=PLUG6vnlr4I_QAgzLqTBfoaVwEH_XrFAIJ) videos.

I have recently (as of May 2021) decided to end this project. So all further videos will be using different projects. Since I have ended the project, I've decided to release the files in the state they were in from the final episode this project was seen in [Shopify Dev Tips: Add Custom Fonts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip40x1vL6Ko).

These files are not a "finished theme", this is just the state they were in when I decided to end the project.
